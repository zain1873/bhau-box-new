      question: "How does the BhauBox subscription work?",
      answer: "BhauBox is a monthly subscription service that delivers carefully curated toys, treats, and accessories for your dog. Each box is customized based on your dog's size, preferences, and any allergies or restrictions you've specified. You can pause, skip, or cancel your subscription at any time."

      category: "subscription",
      question: "Can I customize what's in my dog's box?",
      answer: "Yes! When you sign up, you'll create a detailed profile for your dog including their size, activity level, chew strength, favorite toy types, and any allergies. Our team uses this information to hand-pick items for each box. You can also update preferences anytime in your dashboard."
    },
